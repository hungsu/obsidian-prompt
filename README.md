## Setup

- Create a file in your vault that will contain Prompts, if you do not have one already.
- Add prompts to that file that you'd like to show yourself. A Prompt should be pure text, no markdown, and fit on a single line.
- In Obsidian Settings, find Prompt. Choose the file you created.
- In Obsidian, show yourself a prompt by either:
  - clicking the Sidebar button,
  - Opening Command Palette and choosing Show Random Prompt
  - Assigning a Hotkey to the Show Random Prompt
